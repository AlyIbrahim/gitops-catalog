The installation isn't using the Ansible Automation Platform operator; instead, it is using the provided install process from the Ansible community provided [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/3.4.3/html/administration/openshift_configuration.html)

This is installing the `Ansible Automation Platform Resource Operator` to provide support for the `AnsibleJob` and `JobTemplate` CRD.

The operator deployment is TBD, and the folder `tbd-operator` is a start.
